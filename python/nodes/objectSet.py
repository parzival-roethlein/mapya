should work like a python list
['myNode1', 'myNode2', ...]

different from maya:
- maya does not add existing members (list does)
-- maya ui and set command limit usage equivalent to python set (unique members)
--- but user can avoid that by making manually connections (=python list)
- empty set returns None (instead of empty list [])
- maya does not error when removing non-member (python list does)
- fix inconsistency of cmds.set(objects, rm=set_name) // cmds.set(objects, add=set_name)

other representations:
.getIndexedDependencyNodes() = {0: 'myNode1', 3: 'myNode3'}
.getIndexedDagNodes() = {0: 'myNode2'}


TODO:
- make sequence (or more?):
  requires two methods, not sure which, something like: __len__ and __indexItem__


DECIDE:
- behavior when removing non-existing members:
-- python set does error
-- maya.cmds set command does not error
